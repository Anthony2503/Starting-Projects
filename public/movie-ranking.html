<p>I love the line there that says "It's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world."</p>
<h3>The Harry Potter Series</h3>

<p>I grew up watching the film and love how the characters matures throughout the filming of the movie</p>
<h3>The Avengers Series</h3>

<p>This one I think need no explanation!</p>
<p>Just absolute brilliance. Stan Lee is a LEGEND.</p>
